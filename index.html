    <h1>Color</h1>
    <h2>I love colors and their history</h2>

    <p>I have always loved color, even more so after reading the book, The <a href="https://a.co/d/f4QhVB7">Secret Lives of Color</a>. The "Secret Lives of Colour" is a 2016 non-fiction book by British writer Kassia St. Clair which explores the cultural and social history of colours. The book, which is based on a column St. Clair writes for British magazine Elle Decoration, is organized in a series of chapters by color, arranged from white to black.

    Already a color geek, reading this book further inspired me. I love to add bold, vivid colors to everything I create. I love the notion of a color having a story, some special adventure. I get excited to see what the new Pantone Color of the Year, always reading the back story. Even as a kid, I loved the smell of a fresh, new box of crayons and believe color is a sensory experience and evokes emotion beyond what we see.
